# Machine Learning

This is where I store the basic knowledge about Machine Learning that I have learned and collected in different books and courses. Below is the main content:

## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

An overview of Machine Learning along with practicing Python coding to store files and images. In addition, we will practice a project on predicting house prices to better understand ML and will code a bit about matrix derivatives using Numerical Analysis.

+ [Numerical_in_Matrix_Derivatives.](https://github.com/letruongzzio/Machine-Learning/blob/main/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning/Numerical_in_Matrix_Derivatives.ipynb)
